Personal Project - Missing complete documentation

A proof of concept consolidating a few useful techniques when it comes to procedurally simulating ocean waves.

The main technique used include layering exponential sine waves to form the main body of the waves, computing partial derivatives to calculate the surface normals, and adding some domain warping for artistic effect.

There are many more ways to improve realism, such as swapping out the phong shader for a more physically based one making use of subsurface scattering. Adding foam and spray would also improve the effect. I hope to add all of this and more in the future.
